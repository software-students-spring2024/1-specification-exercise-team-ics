## Product Vision Statement

Our app is designed to aggregate available flight data and costs of traveling to find possible vacation plans for users on a set budget but don't know where to go.

## User Requirements

1. As a frequent flier, I want flight data from different sites and airlines all in one place so that I can save time looking for flights individually.
2. As someone on a strict budget, I want to see all costs from flights, hotels, transportation, and estimated food costs up front so that I won't be surprised by how much I spend later.
3. As a bad vacation planner, I want potential vacation plans suggested to me so that all I need to do is pick and choose.

**We need 7 more of these**
